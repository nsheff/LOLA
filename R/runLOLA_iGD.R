# ENRICHMENT - Actual workhorse enrichment calculation functions
######################################################################

#' Enrichment Calculation
#'
#' Workhorse function that uses iGD to calculate overlaps between userSets,
#' and then uses a fisher's exact test rank them by significance
#' of the overlap.
#'
#' @param userSets		Regions of interest (Can be GRanges objects or a list)
#' @param userUniverse	Regions tested for inclusion in userSets (Can be a GRanges object)
#' @param pepRegionDB	Region DB to check for overlap, output list object from loadPEPdb()
#' @param cores	Number of processors
#' @param redefineUserSets	run redefineUserSets() on your userSets?
#' @param direction    Defaults to "enrichment", but may also accept
#'     "depletion", which will swap the direction of the fisher test (use
#'     'greater' or less' value passed to the 'alternative' option of
#'     fisher.test)
#' @return Data.table with enrichment results. Rows correspond to individual
#' pairwise fisher's tests comparing a single userSet with a single databaseSet.
#' The columns in this data.table are: userSet and dbSet: index into their
#' respective input region sets. pvalueLog: -log10(pvalue) from the fisher's exact
#' result; oddsRatio: result from the fisher's exact test; support: number of
#' regions in userSet overlapping databaseSet; rnkPV, rnkOR, rnkSup: rank in this
#' table of p-value, oddsRatio, and Support respectively. The --value is the
#' negative natural log of the p-value returned from a one-sided fisher's exact
#' test. maxRnk, meanRnk: max and mean of the 3 previous ranks, providing a
#' combined ranking system. b, c, d: 3 other values completing the 2x2 contingency
#' table (with support). The remaining columns describe the dbSet for the row.
#'
#' If you have the qvalue package installed from bioconductor, runLOLA will add
#' a q-value transformation to provide FDR scores automatically.
